Transistor -  Device allowing or not allwing eletricity flow. Controls computers decision making (binary digits). 

Made from semiconductor. Somee times conducts sometimes doesn't conduct electricity. Use silicon (from sand - baked sand) add metal to it to change its property.
Can change state by adding heat that will allow electricity to flow, then change temp and it will no longer flow. 


Internet - Computers connected together. Could connect with a wire. Physical hardward and protocol. 

Protocol - How data is structured broken down and sent (in packets i.e broken down pieces of data) (transferred). 

IP - Internet Protocol

TCP (Transfer control protocol) 

HTTP - Hyper text trans protocol 

SMTP - simple mail transmission protocol 

VOIP - Voice over ignition protocol 

Need different protocols for different types of data. 



WEB - linked up hypertext documents. It can be sent over the internet. 

Need a physical connection around the world to make the internet work. 

Use a browser to retrieve request via internet hardware from web server(computer). Can be done wireless. 


Digital - a machine operating on discrete values. 

Analog - has a dimmer is a dimmer. Continuously changing data signal. 

Computers can only operate  on discrete values. 


SSD Explained. 

Solid State Drive - type of device: storage device. 

A drive is a memory storage device. 

Solid State Drive - no moving parts much faster. Composed electronic parts each of which can hold millions of pieces of electronic information.
